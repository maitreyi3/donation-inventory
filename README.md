# Donation Inventory System

A backend-focused system for managing NGO donations, distributions, and inventory.

This project was designed to emphasize backend engineering fundamentals such as clean data modeling, robust validation, service-oriented design, and automated testing.

To run the project, run:
python main.py

## Design Focus
Key design decisions:
- Donations and distributions are modeled as immutable domain events.
- Inventory is stored as (total donations − total distributions).
- Validation rules are centralized and enforced at input boundaries.
- Business logic is separated from user interaction and API layers for clarity and testability.
- The same core logic is reused by both a CLI interface and a REST API.

## Architecture Overview

- `main.py` — Application entrypoint and control flow
- `cli.py` — Command-line user interaction
- `api.py` — REST API implemented using FastAPI
- `validation.py` — Centralized domain validation rules
- `models.py` — Domain entities (Donation, Distribution)
- `reports.py` — Business logic and reporting
- `tests/` — Unit and API tests

---

## Reporting Logic

### Donor Report
Reflects total contributions made by each donor over time.  
Distributions do not affect this report, as it represents historical donor activity.

### Inventory Report
Reflects current available inventory and is computed dynamically as:

Total donations − total distributions

---

## Running the CLI

The CLI allows users to:
- Register donations
- Record distributions
- View inventory reports
- View donor contribution summaries

Input validation is enforced interactively, with clear error messages and re-prompts.

---

## Backend API

This project includes a RESTful backend API implemented using **FastAPI**.

Available endpoints:
- POST `/donations`
- POST `/distributions`
- GET `/reports/inventory`
- GET `/reports/donors`

The API reuses the same domain models, validation logic, and business rules as the CLI, demonstrating separation of concerns and service-oriented design.

Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI based on the API definitions.  
The API is validated through automated tests rather than requiring a running server.

## Running Tests

Automated unit and API tests are included to verify validation, business logic, and API behavior.

Tests cover:
- Validation rules
- Inventory and donor reporting logic
